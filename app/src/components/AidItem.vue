            The government is proposing to provide eligible small employers a
            temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months. The subsidy
            will be equal to 10% of remuneration paid during that period, up to
            a maximum subsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer.
            This is done by reducing your remittances of income tax withheld on
            your employeesâ€™ remuneration.

            If your employees are eligible for Employment Insurance (EI)
            benefits, and your business is suffering a downturn due to COVID-19,
            you can apply for a work-sharing agreement. The agreement would
            allow them to work a temporarily reduced work week while receiving
            EI benefits.
