        <b-card-body>
          The government is proposing to provide eligible small employers a
          temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months. The subsidy will
          be equal to 10% of remuneration paid during that period, up to a
          maximum subsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer. This
          is done by reducing your remittances of income tax withheld on your
          employeesâ€™ remuneration.

          If your employees are eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits,
          and your business is suffering a downturn due to COVID-19, you can
          apply for a work-sharing agreement. The agreement would allow them to
          work a temporarily reduced work week while receiving EI benefits.

          The CRA will allow all businesses to defer, until after August 31,
          2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing on or
          after today and before September 2020. No interest or penalties will
          accumulate on these amounts during this period. For self-employed, the
          tax deadline is extended from June 15th to July 31st.
