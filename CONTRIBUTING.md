There are two primary ways to help:

- Using the issue tracker, and
- Changing the code-base.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have
been validated with statements pertaining to the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines mimiced the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.
